RobotTest
=========
Very Broken! 
VERY BROKEN!
Oh, and did I mention very broken.

What is this:
=============
This is some sample code to test canidates on their ability to look at code
and devise a test plan and create tests.  

Installation:
=============
Requires Python.  I've tested with python 2.7.3.  

Usage:
=============
Simply run:

> python robottest.py

Basic Spec:
===========
So this Dameon is to open up a port 2059 and listen to incomming connection. 
At which point it has a basic telnet style user/pass prompt.  You are allowed 3
attempts to enter correct user/name password.  Usernames and password are case 
sensitive.  At which point there are some basic commands available.

And that's all you get.  This is white box testing so have a look at the code
for the rest of what can be done.
